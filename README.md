Initial features:  

    This website is a sales website, we will be selling technology as an example.  This will be user interactive friendly.  Almost everything that is rendered on the dom should be interactable.  Users should be able to login, logout, and create a user.  If there is an admin user, they should be able to login with their admin account and be able to manage almost anything.  Such as change price of sales, delete items, add items, and so on.  Users should also be able to view a specific item they want to purchase or just to view.  A user can also leave a review of a product.

	As soon as a new user or any user comes to the website, they will be redirected to the main page.  This page will contain special deals, recommended items, etc.  There will be tabs for the user to navigate through.  If the user doesn’t know the name of the item they’re looking for, navigation will be helpful.  It’s more of a navigation filter.  Users will also be able to use a search filter.  When a user searches for an item, they will be able to find it.

	If a user uses the navigation filter, they will be redirected to a page of the product type they selected.  If a user selects an item, they will be redirected to the specific item.  This website will have a slider that will display featured items.  This slider is interactable with the user.  If the user clicks on the featured item they want, they will be redirected to that item.

How this project will meet the minimum project requirements:

	This website will meet the following requirements by using a front-end framework called React.  Our team will use React, CSS, JS, NodeJS, and Bootstrap for designing the application.  The back-end will be using React for routing and any extra back-end work that will need to be implemented.  The next set of back-end tech will be Express.  This will be used for JWT tokens and authentication.  The Database we will be using is SQL, the program SQL Workbench.  This will be able to manage any data for our marketing website.  This will be perfect to hold details about a product.  This web application will very much be responsive and have excellent design to the application.
